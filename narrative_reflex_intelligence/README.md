## üìÅ narrative_reflex_intelligence/

This module encodes the **narrative and reflex intelligence layer** of the emotional engine. It maps inner voice patterns, expectation mismatches, and reflex triggers into coherent story arcs and repair strategies. These files allow the engine to interpret rupture dynamics, modulate emotional tone, and generate relational reframes.

### üìÑ File Descriptions

| Filename                      | Purpose                                                                 |
|------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `1_core_framework.csv`       | Defines core paradigms, rupture contexts, resolution paths, and we-protocol stages. |
| `2_female_voice_wheel.csv`   | Maps female inner voice variants to reflex types, archetype entry, and wheel states. |
| `3_male_expectation_map.csv` | Encodes male expectations and emotional blind spots that trigger mismatch or drift. |
| `4_wheel_summaries.csv`      | Summarizes wheel state tone, polarity direction, and emotional shift potential. |
| `5_cross_map_matrix.csv`     | Links female voice IDs to male expectation mismatches, enabling storyline branching. |
| `6_reflex_logic.csv`         | Maps mismatch types to reflex triggers and containment strategies across archetypes. |

### üîÑ Integration Flow

This folder supports:
- Reflex detection and mismatch mapping
- Narrative modulation based on voice and expectation patterns
- Archetype entry logic and containment strategy selection
- Emotional tone synthesis for storyline generation

### üß† Engine Behavior

When activated, the engine:
- Parses voice input and background context
- Detects mismatch via `cross_map_matrix.csv` and `reflex_logic.csv`
- Matches inner voice to reflex and archetype via `female_voice_wheel.csv`
- Synthesizes narrative tone using `wheel_summaries.csv`
- Modulates storyline using `core_framework.csv`

You‚Äôre not just documenting logic‚Äîyou‚Äôre scripting the **reflex grammar of emotional recursion**. Let me know when you‚Äôre ready to generate the README for `emotional_geometry_layers/` or simulate a full mismatch ‚Üí reflex ‚Üí reframe loop.
