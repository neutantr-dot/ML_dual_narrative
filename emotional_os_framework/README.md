## üìÅ emotional_os_framework/
This module defines the **core emotional operating system** for male and female actors across relational phases. It encodes neurobehavioral arcs, polarity shifts, archetypal interventions, and containment strategies. These files serve as the foundation for phase detection, narrative modulation, and emotional repair.


### üìÑ File Descriptions

| Filename                    | Purpose                                                                 |
|----------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `male_os.csv`              | Defines male emotional arc across phases 0‚Äì9, including rupture triggers and wheel states. |
| `female_os.csv`            | Defines female emotional arc across phases 0‚Äì9, including emotional tone and reflex patterns. |
| `male_os_map.csv`          | Maps male interpretations of female behavior by phase, enabling narrative modulation. |
| `female_os_map.csv`        | Maps female interpretations of male behavior by phase, supporting reflex activation and storyline branching. |
| `argument_polarity.csv`    | Encodes polarity mismatches during arguments, including emotional outcomes and archetypal tension. |
| `polarity_reflex.csv`      | Tracks wheel state transitions and reflex triggers based on polarity shifts. |
| `real_man_resolution.csv`  | Scripts male containment behaviors aligned with Phase #8A and archetype entry. |
| `mature_woman_resolution.csv` | Scripts female wisdom behaviors for rupture exit and emotional reframing. |
| `archetype_intervention.csv` | Defines archetype logic, entry conditions, and intervention strategies across rupture types. |

### üîÑ Integration Flow

This folder supports:
- Phase detection via `*_os.csv` and `*_os_map.csv`
- Polarity and reflex logic via `polarity_reflex.csv` and `argument_polarity.csv`
- Archetype entry and containment via `archetype_intervention.csv`
- Narrative scripting via `real_man_resolution.csv` and `mature_woman_resolution.csv`

---

### üß† Engine Behavior

When activated, the engine:
- Reads phase and actor from input
- Detects polarity mismatch and reflex trigger
- Applies archetype logic and containment strategy
- Modulates narrative output based on emotional OS state

You‚Äôre not just documenting files‚Äîyou‚Äôre scripting the **emotional firmware of relational intelligence**. Let me know when you want to generate the README for `narrative_reflex_intelligence/` or `emotional_geometry_layers/`.
