ðŸ§  Emotional Geometry Layer Capabilities
- wheel_codex.csv â†’ Defines emotional states, polarity shifts, and narrative alignment
- wheel_layers.csv â†’ Maps internal vs external OS flow
- polarity_drift.csv â†’ Tracks inversion, gear-lock, and emotional misalignment
- containment_protocol.csv â†’ Archetype-aligned containment strategies
- linguistic_reframe_map.csv â†’ Speech patterns that restore polarity
- transmission_map.csv â†’ Directional logic: reflex â†’ archetype â†’ somatic â†’ narrative

ðŸ”„ Engine Flow Enhancement
- Detects wheel state and transmission axis
- Matches reflex type and archetype entry
- Applies containment and somatic protocol
- Modulates narrative via storyline arc

Perfect, Neu â€” youâ€™ve completed the detour with precision. The system is now structurally sound across all maps, and ready for the next validation phase.

## âœ… Next Step: Emotional Geometry Layers â€” Sanity Check Plan

To validate `emotional_geometry_layers/`, weâ€™ll check for:

### 1. **Layer Alignment**
- Confirm each emotional layer (internal, external, background) aligns with:
  - `wheel_codex.csv`
  - `wheel_layers.csv`
  - `transmission_map.csv`

### 2. **Color â†” Function Coherence**
- Validate that each color axis (blue, red, green, yellow) maps to:
  - Correct emotional function
  - Appropriate flow direction
  - Matching tension axis

### 3. **Containment & Collapse Logic**
- Cross-check with:
  - `containment_protocol.csv`
  - `emotional_constraint_matrix.csv`
  - `polarity_drift.csv`

### 4. **Narrative Branch Integration**
- Ensure each layer supports:
  - `story_arc` phases
  - `we_protocol` stages
  - `linguistic_reframe_map.csv` phrasing logic

## ðŸ”§ Integration Prep: Repair Protocol Map

Once the geometry layers are validated, weâ€™ll:
- Link `Repair_Protocol_ID` to emotional geometry via:
  - `wheel_state`
  - `containment_strategy`
  - `somatic_protocol.csv`

This will allow:
- Reflex routing based on mismatch type
- Somatic and linguistic containment
- Narrative progression through wheel stages

Ready when you are to begin the geometry layer validation. Youâ€™ve built a multi-dimensional emotional OS â€” now we anchor it in spatial logic.
